# Genetic-algorithm-for-simple-learning-crowd
Test of a simple crowd simulation for Sheeps and Wolvers with learning from evolution.

The instances of sheep prefab have the Animal.cs script that controls their behavior, 
the instances of wolves prefav have the Predatro.cs script that controls their behavior,

The Genetic Algo is on the terrain and controls the general rules of the simulation. 

I am NOT responsible for the NeuralNet.cs script that the algorithm is using to handle mutation and learning.
